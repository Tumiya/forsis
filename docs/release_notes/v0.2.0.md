### Enhancements:

- [#7](https://github.com/azohra/forsis/issues/7): Upgrade Nokogiri to version `~> 1.12.5`. We prefer bounded version requirement for this dependency.
- Set a more explicit minimum supported Ruby version. The required Ruby version for Forsis is `>= 2.5`.
- Add a CI/CD pipeline to ensure the quality and speed of the deployments.
- Upgrade RuboCop and implement the updated coding styles. 
- Create Github releases to provide the release notes to users.
